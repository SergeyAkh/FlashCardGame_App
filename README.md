This is a game that might help me memorize foreign language words by asking to write translation into my native language or vice versa.<br />
The idea was to help me learn a new language. <br />

There is advantage of the program, is that it shows words based on statistics of combined fiature: count of apperanse of each word and count of my right answers, the lower these value the more likely word will appere. 
<br />
However, this program has a drawback.
I had to create my own dictionary in Google Sheets and wright an API requsts, in order to program works. <br />

There were implemented fiatures such as adding new word at the end of the dictionary, and edit current word if I spoted an error. <br />

If I don't know the word I can use hint field, it can shows me the meaning of the word in my native language spell by letter.<br />

If a word is being learned and I don't want it to be in the dictionary, I can simply delete it.<br />

And of course there is a opportunity to swap the languages and test my self in a different way.<br />
