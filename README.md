This is a game that might help to memorize words of foreign language by asking to write translation into native language or vice versa.<br />
The idea was to help learn a new language. <br />

Advantage of this program is that it shows words based on statistics of combined feature: quantity of apperanse of each word and quantity of right answers, the lower the value of this index the more likely word will appear. 
<br />
However, this program has a drawback.
It requires a Google Sheets spreadsheet as dictionary. <br />

There were implemented features such as adding new word at the end of the dictionary, and editting current word if the error in spalling or translation was made. <br />

If user does't know the word he can use hint field, that shows the meaning of the word in native language letter by letter.<br />

If a word was learned and I user does't want it to be in the dictionary, he can simply delete it.<br />

And of course there is a opportunity to swap the languages and test myself in a different way.<br />

There is screenshots below. <br />
