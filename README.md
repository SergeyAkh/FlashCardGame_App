This is a game that might help memorize words of foreign language by asking to write translation into native language or vice versa.<br />
The idea was to help learn a new language. <br />

Advantage of this program is that it shows words based on statistics of combined feature: count of apperanse of each word and count of right answers, the lower these value the more likely word will appeares. 
<br />
However, this program has a drawback.
It requires a Google Sheets spreadsheet as dictionary. <br />

There were implemented features such as adding new word at the end of the dictionary, and edit current word if an error where spoted. <br />

If I don't know the word I can use hint field, it can shows the meaning of the word in native language letter by letter.<br />

If a word where learned and I don't want it to be in the dictionary, I can simply delete it.<br />

And of course there is a opportunity to swap the languages and test my self in a different way.<br />

There is screenshots below. <br />
